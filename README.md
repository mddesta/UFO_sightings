# [UFOsightings](https://mddesta.github.io/UFO_sightings/)

For this assignment, I performed the following tasks:
1. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
2. Used a date form in the HTML document to write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
